## Summary

**Summary of YouTube Video: Claude Code vs. Cursor – Is Claude Code Changing AI Programming?**

**Main Points:**
- **Claude Code Overview:** The video discusses Claude Code, a new AI programming agent developed by Anthropic, and compares it to other tools like Cursor and Windsurf. The guest, AI coding expert Ross Mike, provides insights into what makes Claude Code distinctive in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI code assistants.
- **Key Differences from Other Tools:** While tools such as Cursor, Windsurf, and others (including classic editors like VS Code) all utilize similar foundational AI models (often Claude 4), their uniqueness comes from the custom tooling layered on top—like file reading, writing, and context management utilities built by each company.
- **Secret Sauce:** Cursor and Windsurf differentiate themselves through how they design and integrate their tools, manage memory and context, and in some cases, begin to train their own models for specialized use cases.
- **Model vs. Tools:** The underlying AI model (e.g., Claude 4) alone isn't useful for programming tasks unless paired with effective tools that can interact with files, carry context, and automate workflows. The competition lies in who can build smarter, more efficient tools and agents.
- **Anthropic’s Unique Advantage:** Claude Code is developed by the same team that builds the Claude model. According to insights shared from a Claude Code conference, about 95% of Anthropic’s own engineers now use Claude Code, reflecting its power and internal adoption.
- **Agentic Behavior:** Claude Code exhibits more autonomous, agent-like capabilities—such as auto-mode to carry tasks to completion, writing and running tests, and generally handling larger and more complex codebases more effectively than alternatives.
- **Why Claude Code Feels Superior:** The integration between the model and its purpose-built tooling by Anthropic gives Claude Code an edge—allowing for a smoother, more cohesive, and intelligent coding experience.
- **On Layering Tools:** Some people use Claude Code within other tool interfaces like Cursor, but there can be tradeoffs and usability quirks, especially around file navigation and context unless the integration is seamless.

**Key Insights:**
- **Vertical Integration:** When the model creator also builds the tools and agent, there’s a better fit and potential for more sophisticated features and seamless performance.
- **Agentic Future:** The ability for coding AI to run autonomously, write tests, and iterate on large projects highlights the growing power of AI as an “agent” rather than a mere assistant.
- **Customization Is King:** The current wave of code assistants is marked by rapid experimentation around tool-building, context management, and even custom AI model training.

**Actionable Takeaways:**
1. **For Developers:** Try Claude Code, especially if you work on large or complex codebases. Its auto-mode and agent-like features may boost productivity compared to existing editors/assistants.
2. **For Teams:** Evaluate not just the AI model but also the surrounding tooling and integration when choosing AI code assistants. The right combination can impact efficiency far more than model choice alone.
3. **For Builders:** If developing AI-powered tools, focus on tight integration between your agent and the underlying model, and tailor custom tools for context, memory, and workflow management.
4. **For Early Adopters:** Experiment with using Claude Code both standalone and embedded within other tools (like Cursor) to find the workflow that best fits your needs, but be aware of current interface limitations that may require workarounds.

**Conclusion:**
Claude Code stands out by uniting model and tool development under one roof, offering greater agentic behavior and internal adoption than competitors. The future of AI programming assistants lies in deeper integration, more autonomous workflows, and continuous iteration on both models and the tools that activate them.

Many people think that cloud code is better than cursor. So, I brought on an AI coding expert, Ross Mike, to break down what cla code is and why it's changing the world of AI coding. We talked about how Cloud Code is different than tools like Cursor and Windsor. We talked about how to get started building with Claude Code. We looked at an app that Mickey built fully with Claude Code. And we also talked about why Anthropic is building Claude Code the way they are. Let's dive in. Ross Mike, in your last YouTube video, you said that Claude Code is the best programming agent, and I've actually heard other people say the same. Do you really think that it is better than tools like cursor? I think so. I believe so. Um, not only have I used it like very much in the last two weeks, but I also understand why I think that way. And I want to kind of explain if it's okay with you share my screen and sort of like just get into Excaladron diagram why I think so more than anything one thing that we all understand is that Claude is the best model for programming right I think um we all understand that all the big providers have sort of picked their lane like OpenAI seems to be going for the more personable BTOC feely you know human companion type vibe and then Enthropic has picked its lane where it wants to go into the programming lane and I actually was at a claude code conference where they announced claude code and the big difference really is if you're using cursor wind surf zed like whatever it is right I know everyone has their camps like we have cursor here we have wind surf here and then let's say you're you know an OG and you you're using VS code right um if you're using any of these like tools you notice that some people are like I think cursor is better. Some are like, "I think Windsor's better." And some are like, "Oh, they're the same. I just use VS Code." Underlyingly, they all use the same model. Now, the question is, what really makes them different? Why could one user think Windsurf is better than one user thinking cursor is better? Now, there is some sort of anecdotal point to it where like maybe someone just had a good run and they think it's better and someone had a bad run with the other two, but really the the difference is they're all using the same model, but they're all building their own tools, right? So, the model in it of itself is is useless, right? It's just an image. It's just a resource store. Has all these all this knowledge, right? So you can ask it questions but if you tell claude 4 uh read this file in my codebase and tell me what it does it has no way of doing so. So what makes cursor wind surf and vs code um unique is they have tools that they've built right. So for example like if you use cursor and you you look at the tools it calls like you'll see something like um file reader right and then like you or you'll see something like I don't know if you've ever like seen like um cursor winds surf when they're about to push an update sometimes like you see gibberish if you look at the gibberish it'll be like writing file right so you'll see that what makes cursor and windsurf different is that although they're using the same underline line model they're developing their own tools right so cursor has its own file reader tool and the way this works is maybe I can like illustrate this better is let's say this user right goes to cursor right this user is using cursor and this user asks cursor cursor can you change the color of this page to green what happens is cursor fires that off to cloud 40 and cloud 40 is going to say oh the user wants me to change the color of this page. I need to know where the page is. So what Claude is going to do is Claude is going to fire off the tool that cursor has provided for Claude. And that tool is going to read the file, give the contents back to Claude. Now Claude is then going to be like, okay, this is where the file is. This is the code that I need to change. Now I need to change it. So Claude then fires off the other tool and this tool allows it to write to the file. Right? These tools are developed by cursor, windsurf, VS code and how they've implemented these tools, how these tools work together, the efficiency of the tools, how they handle context, memory. This is sort of the secret sauce uh that cursor and windsurf are fighting for which is why if you notice Windsorf developed its own model and cursor raised a bajillion dollars and they're probably going to develop their own models because right now what they're fighting over is this. This is this their differentiator right now because everyone is using claude 4, right? But what happens is when they have their own models now they can have their own models that are trained a certain way and that becomes an edge for them. That's a business podcast. But underlying this is how cursor and winf work. They have tools, memory, uh different ways of handling context like they'll even maybe fine-tune specific models for certain things. And um you know working at an AI startup I know this it's not just one giant clawed agent they probably have multiple agents maybe even using different uh models right maybe they have like a specific model and they use Gemini like 2.5 flash because it has a large context window that ingests the entire codebase and gives like summarized context to cla because claude is expensive. I say that to say this is the edge that cursor and winerve have. Now where does claude code come into play? Claude code although not a similar interface meaning they didn't fork VS code um claude code is essentially built on claude's model right but they this time have built their own tool calling and this is sort of the understanding I have like I spoke with some of the team at claude at the conference and first and foremost they're going all in on this second of all they told me 95% of their engineers use cla code very you are using cursor and windsurf. The other 5% are just rebels who want to use like vim or like maybe they'll use like uh like you know cursor or wind surf but majority of their developers are using cloud code. It was an originally an internal tool now they've made public and the thought process I have is the one developing the model will probably know the best way to develop the tools right and this is why for my personal usage again I don't have like data like intrinsic data for you to say oh this is the percentage but for my personal use especially with larger code bases claude code seems to understand code better and execute code better and it does feel more agentic Right? You can allow it to continue on like I think it's called auto mode or something. You enable it and not only will it continue till the task task is complete but there are certain instances where it will try to write tests and it will test the code right it does feel a lot more agentic um than cursor and windsurf and VS code and cursor launched with 1.0 background jobs or background agents I think that's what they call it and that's what I would say is a direct competitor to claude code. So the reason why I think cloud code is is better is because the model provider is finally building the tools that make tools like cursor and windsurf better and who better build it than the one actually developing the model. So that's kind of my spiel and my thesis as to why I think cloud code is better. When you use cloud code, do you use it within cursor? I've heard some people use cloud code in cursor and so like is that just like the ultimate stack? Because like I tried to use cloud code and I actually asked cursor how to set it up and I actually got it set up but I didn't have the normal IDE so it was hard for me to go to the right file like cuz I was like uploading images and I was trying to give it context of the file that I wanted to reference but like there was nothing to look at. So can you talk about why people use cloud code within cursor and then like why you think this like what do you think of this interface of cloud code versus cursor? It's definitely very geared to developers. And my actually favorite setup is I don't know if you can see my cursor is the way I kind of have it set up is I will have Claude like I'll open Claude code and and I I can show like how like you set it up. I just want to give you like a quick rundown on how I have it set up is I'll pin Claude code to the top left and then I'll still have my terminal here and then I'll have my cursor chat and what I've really been enjoying is I'll use cursor like I'll use cloud for asking so basically like I'll build my understanding of what it's doing how this codebase works or I'll build like my questions like this is like the assistant I ask questions and cloud code is sort of my executor. So it it is true in a sense where I think especially for a vibe coder it's best to mingle the two. I don't think you should use claude code by itself with like a VS code or just raw dog it on terminal. I think it becomes very confusing. Um but if you couple it with let's say you're windurf guy windsurf and cloud code or you're um you know a cursor person cursor and cloud code I think you get the best of both worlds. And here's here's the best part. I know there was a lot of compare comparison videos u but you can use both right which to me seems like a great compromise right I can use cloud code and if it feels like it's not my type of thing I can use um like cursor chat but I think what makes cloud code special is the model provider is building the tools and I don't know if I've just been on a hot streak but I've had instances where like the regular whether it be cursor winds surf just would not get it done quad even though it took longer got the task done and the thesis that I'm going with is the same thing I shared is I think the model provider building the tools for the model uh they just end up knowing what works best right so um I highly highly recommend if you're going to give cloud code a shot definitely couple it with your favorite ID whether it be cursor because you have to remember I mean these companies are hedging right like cursor and windsurf at least up until a few months ago are building their models to be are building their uh product to be model agnostic to use any of the models. Now with Windsurf, it's interesting because Windinsurf is rumored to be bought by OpenAI for $3 billion and now is anthropic cutting them off of tokens intentionally or unintentionally. I don't want to get into the rumors. I don't think it matters that much. But like if you think about it, um it makes sense that the to the company like if you really think the edge is in the tools that it's uses like whatever like if Quad ends up being the best coding model in the world, you would think that Anthropic would be the best at building those tools around it because they can build the model specifically for those tools. Um Exactly. Exactly. They have the cheat. They literally have the cheat code and then it just makes sense for them to go all in at that point because if they can own programming like that seems, you know, and that that makes sense to me that Claude just owns the programming side and OpenAI owns the kind of the the the become your best friend personality side or whatever hardware they're building. So that's really really interesting. Cursor and Windsorf I think they are starting to see that Claude is sort of inching in the direction where at first there was a big separation, right? Claude was like, "We'll just provide the model. You two battle it out with UX. You two battle it out with actually getting users." Now it seems like Claude is stepping in that front and cursor and windsurf. You also want I think the moat for them becomes the model, right? Um Vzero launched like their own specific model that's trained on Nex.js and stuff. And I think like for tools like this, if they build their own specialty models based on, you know, all the training data they get from the users or they see what people really like to use from a business perspective, it does make a lot of sense. They also get to raise a lot of money to justify doing that, right? So, this is sort of how I've been thinking about it. I don't know if you've used uh Wind Surfers, I think it's SWE1. It was actually a decent experience. I didn't really get to use it as much, but it was very fast. It it it felt like the tabbing felt very fresh. It felt like it was a pleasantly good experience. So, I do see cursor-1 or windsurf version two coming out soon. So, that's why I'm kind of like like and if you're like an AI builder, like cloud code has an SDK coming out too where you can literally build on top of it. So, it it seems to me they're they're definitely coming for everyone's lunch. Wait, talk about that for a second. Um, you said it has an SDK which means people can build their own custom interfaces for it. So yeah, instead of like you know your your your tempos, your lovables, your bullets, your vibe code, like instead of like building the tools for your agent and all that stuff, they're literally like right now it's terminal based, but u their team said if I'm not mistaken, yeah, the SDK currently supports command line usage, TypeScript and Python SDK coming soon. So they're entering a world where they're telling the upandcomers, these guys will probably always build their own stuff, but the upandcomers like you focus on UX, we'll handle everything else for you, right? So you can imagine yourself building a very clean, seamless UX that literally runs on cloud code and you end up having a model that competes with all these other guys, right? So it it that's interesting. I think there's going to be some use cases for that that aren't like just broad coding things. Like I feel like there you like there's going to be like micro coding tools for one specific niche that might be on the mobile device or um I don't know I've never thought about this before but my mind is running with a bunch of different ideas because if you you could basically create a cla wrapper and if you think claude code is as good as cursor then you know we're going to get like something that is as powerful as a cursor wrapper and that's terrifying like you know as someone who is we're building a a a a vibe coding startup you know it's It's terrifying to think that anyone can create a claude code rapper, but it's also very fun and interesting and maybe um yeah, I don't I don't know I don't even know what to say to that. I mean, what do you 6 months from now, what do you think that looks like? Like what do you think people are going to build on top of uh of cloud code? You're right. What happens when everyone has access to the greatest agent, coding agent, and can build on top of it? I I do think uh niche or niche, I never know which one is the correct pronunciation. Specific like uh platforms are going to win. Like for example, let's say you have a vibe coding tool that's specific to React, right? Or you have a vibe coding tool specific to like WordPress or whatever, right? I think like the niche tools are going to start to win cuz you can sort of like I I I they haven't mentioned any fine-tuning, but I can imagine like if you could fine-tune the model to specific like types of programming or frameworks or stuff like that and you build like specialized user interface and you have content, right? The model is definitely the model arena is definitely getting um uh taken over by cloud code and unless one of these guys and that's their goal and that's why cursor raised 900 freaking million dollars is cuz the only thing you can really build to withstand this behemoth is build another one right so build anthropic yeah that's literally all you could do right cuz like at some point like the tool calling like at first I remember when GPT 4 just came out we were like on 3.5 to 4 like people were building like these open-source like I remember one of them was called like autog and the uniqueness was like being able to like have tools right and tools were a big deal now tools have become normal and then we have the MCP era and like like this mo that these tools had is disappearing very very slowly and on top of that they forked VS code we can all fork VS code right so the the the the big differentiator they and have is to build richer UX on top of what they have which cursor made a big bed background agents. They I don't know if you saw they have their code reviewer which is like a code rabbit alternative right so they're building around the IDE but then they're also going to build a model which makes sense but for also they're also building a mobile app too like cursor is building a mobile app I didn't even know that so that's insane yeah yeah I follow their head designer on on X um and yeah he's been posting it for a couple months now um some sneak peeks of what it will look like so they're building a mobile app so yeah I think Yeah, I mean it's it's probably time for cursor to expand out into other niches and and um try and figure out other ways to get some sort of edge because I do every single high like at at our company our backend developer was like oh my god claude code is so much better than cursor right now. like he is like blown away and he's just like I literally tried cursor and wind surf for 30 minutes and then claude code just one prompted it and like he'll just like enter a prompt and then just like walk away for seven or eight minutes and come back. That's the crazy part like and that's where like it actually feels agentic. I know we've been saying agentic this whole time but Claude Code is the one and I sound like a shill by the way mind you they're not paying me. I wish they were, but it genuinely it it's the first time I felt agentic. And I I'll say it's the first time I felt like, huh? Yeah. Programmers who don't use these tools, yeah, like you're you're you're definitely going to get like outshipped. Like I know we've been saying this this whole time, but for the most part, I'm like, man, a really talented senior developer can like go insane, but Cloud Co is the first time I'm like, yeah, like this this is real. Like this is powerful. So one question I have for you is like so codeex was recently released like in the last year by openai. What is the difference between codeex and cloud code and then something like devon? What about those three tools? Cuz it seems like they don't have kind of the standard interfaces like these three uh tools that you have here. What is the difference between these tools? I'll explain the difference between Codex and cloud code. So the underlying difference is codeex works on the cloud and cloud code works on your local development like on on your computer and there's pros and cons to both. I think the right bet is local just because um like and especially if you're building like serious applications and there's maybe certain things you need to install like you're limited to what OpenAI allows you to install with codeex, right? versus with cloud code. I mean on my computer I can install whatever I want. I could start malware, right? So like that's I would say the big differentiator and obviously the models that they use. I've used um Codeex before. Codex is pretty good. It's not Cloud Code though. Like I will just say this in terms of like sheer power and output and speed. I definitely think Cloud Code takes it. But again, when I look at codeex and them betting them making it on the cloud, it makes sense for let's say if you're a vibe coder or you're not really comfortable, like I know many vibe coders are comfortable with cursor and wind surf, but let's think even broader. Most people are not, right? And if you can go from your like friendly chat assistant to being able to tell it to build something and they almost make it feel very intuitive and clean and simple, then codeex wins big with that market, right? So I would say right you could almost make codeex a tool that chatpt could have access to in theory if it's in the cloud like you could say hey create an app and you could literally just do this in chatpt and then it just says okay running that tool and then maybe it sends it back to you and it's just a web app link that you can open up right there and you can look at it and you go back to chatbt and say no change it and like that is that's pretty big and I I don't count that out for open AAI if there's One thing that OpenA has proved to us over the year is that they have knocked the park out of consumer, right? Perplexity held search down and then Chad GBT came with their search massive, right? Deep research came massive, right? Image Gen came massive, right? So, I definitely wouldn't count them out in terms of like being able to build consumer products or things that consumers will want to use. I just think in terms of like if I were to pick one, I would go with Cloud Code cuz Cloud Code just seems to and I think it's a it's a design choice that they went for the terminal because they don't really want to build the UX layer for you and all that stuff. Use whatever you're already using and this is truly an agent that you just install in whatever you're using, right? So, I think it's a purposeful design choice and that's what makes in my opinion cloud code better than Codeex. It's more for me for you for someone who's a power user. Devon is different though. I would put Devon in the same say this is code review like this is one spectrum of code review and let's say this is another spectrum of like agent. I would put Devon somewhere around here, right? Maybe maybe in the middle, right? Somewhere like in this spectrum where I don't think and I haven't used Devon heavily, but based on the people I know at different companies who work at they'll use Devon for speak feature specific team things, right? So you already have an existing codebase, right? It's functional, it's in production, you have your git workflows, you have a way of deploying to production, you have a staging environment. Devon integrates well with that. You can tell it what to do on Slack and it will basically build you a feature, right? Or it will review an existing feature that you've built, right? You have then Code Rabbit, right? And I'll maybe make this clearer for everyone to see. I would put, let me just clear this up. I would put Code Rabbit here. And by the way, I would 100% use Code Rabbit. like their free tier is pretty good if your thing is open source and if it's not I think it's a couple dollars a month like code rabbit is a great code reviewer so like whatever they do at I know they're not an agent but what what at code review it is great I can't tell you the amount of bugs I've caught using code rabbit so excellent at what they do cursors build just just to clear things up I've used code rabbit I've actually have code rabbit I used it like once and to my knowledge it's like when you ship a new feature and you upload it to GitHub It will basically look at the changes you made and be like, "Hey, like this is good or like no, you should change this. You could do this better." And it helps you. It's like one layer to like catch mistakes or something like that. See, the thing is it's great because if you've noticed this like Riley and I like I love your feedback is whenever you start off a project with any model really um it always starts strong but as it continues to go on like like either performance goes out of whack or the model just started losing like it's easy to start it's hard to finish right and there's a thing with like maybe the model has too much context this is why they tell you create a new chat start fresh and all that stuff with code rabbit it gets your code all at once And it just I think because it's not being repetitively used like the other like tools, it just is great at catching like either flaws or security mistakes or misoptimizations. Right. So I think so you're saying that like when you're using cursor because you need to manage your context and you can't speak into the same agent window for hours that like it's going to lose track of what you're doing in while you're using cursor. But this is kind of a good thing like once you end your full session which might be 10 different agent uh chat windows this will see it all at once and analyze it all at once so that you don't miss the big ones. Okay. So this is my technical theory right it could be something else but based off my experience code rabbit like it's just been like and this is from like I'm talking from also other developers. I'm using it in big projects and it's just been great and it's something simply you install and it literally one thing that I love. I don't know if I have a repo I can show but um it will give you a prompt to give the agent like if you're using cloud code or cursor it will tell you this is the bug that I found. Copy this prompt and paste it in whatever tool you're using and it will fix it for you. Right? So, um I think this is one of those quick wins that if you haven't been using again, they're not paying me. I wish they were. Hopefully, they do one day. Um I it's it's a simple addition. And then for agent, we have Claude code on this side of the spectrum. And then Devon is somewhere here where it's great at code review, but it can also build features. But I haven't heard any stories of people building Devon like something from scratch. And to um the company's point, they called it what? An AI software engineer. And more than likely for like big companies um like a software engineer is not going to be building something from scratch, right? They're probably going to build and maintain features, right? So if that's what they're building Devon for, um that's perfect. So if you're a vibe coder and your product hasn't hit product market fit and you haven't hired developers, I don't really think you need def. I think you get you something like a cursor wind surf plus cloud code if you want to be fancy and code rabbit to review your stuff. I think you have a solid stack. Okay, that's yeah, you heard it here. And then so codeex codeex would be to the right of Devon. Yeah, so left of cloud code. Yes, something like somewhere right here. And mind you, not saying it's more of a code reviewer, but I would just say even though I would align it similarly with cloud code, I think cloud code is just more powerful simply for the fact that codeex is cloud uh based. And that's the problem with cloud where let's say you want to spin up a server. Let's say you want to have multiple servers. Let's say you want to, you know, whatever that it is that you want to do, there's a certain limitation you have with cloud versus with your own local machine, you can run and install whatever you want. Or even like security reasons, right? Say, you know, I wanted to build a, you know, blockchain project. Why? I don't know. But let's say I do, right? There there's certain security things and keys and stuff like that that I just wouldn't want on the cloud versus with cloud code, it's all on my machine, my machine. So, if I were to be launching into a long project, right, like you and I are going to do in a future episode, where do you start? Right? Um, I think that is a big question for vibe coders. think what you know you know lovable tempo bolt um the whole nine yards all those companies do a really good job of doing is kind of giving you a place to start from you know like if you just open up cloud code it's hard to know what to do I know you can open up cursor a fresh project on cursor and you could say build all the files and it will just do it I guess like I guess in the next episode when we when we build something from scratch using only AI and cloud code how are we going to start and like how are we going to think about Here's the way I I I I think of this, right? And and this is stuff I've done for myself without AI. Um you realize that most projects have sort of the same base foundation, meaning you'll need a landing page, right? Simple. You'll need authentication, right? You'll want to authenticate the user. You want to store some user information, right? You want the user to be able to log in with Google, email, whatever it is, right? You'll want a database to store this information, right? And here's one thing I want to say. The one thing that actually frustrates me, Riley, is when I see vibe coders debate on which database platform makes more sense for you. It doesn't matter. Believe me, until you hit PMF and it scales, then you can worry about it. But until then, bro, you use Superbase, use Convex. By the way, I prefer Convex. But whatever it is that you use, doesn't matter, right? It it it doesn't matter. It's the Midwit meme, you know, like where like, you know, the the people I mean, it's like it's like if if if the the database because I looked at the numbers, right? It um if when you're using Firebase versus if you're using Superbase or or Instant DB, you know, there's a lot of different tools you can use. it really doesn't become that big of an expense until you're really you're making a so much revenue that like hiring someone to come in and figure that out for you is going to be very easy, right? Um especially if you're if you have the proper monetization in the app that you're creating, right? Like and so yeah, it doesn't really matter. And even I think the cursor wind surf debate is kind of not even worth it really because at the end of the day it's it's going to come down to like especially if you're vibe coding and you're not using AI it's going to come down to like how meticulous you are like and like it's going to come down to grit determination and then discipline in like building actually building the one feature that you need to make a solid app which is where I think a lot of people go wrong. and they try and build a a ton of different features into an app and then they just get lost when they should have and could have easily built that one feature like I call it the halo feature that is at the center of their marketing um and they just could have marketed that one feature really well and once you kind of have that revenue coming in then you can worry about expanding it out and even hiring a team to come help you. We need a DB, we need O and we need to accept payments. And one thing I'll add like if there's one thing I would focus on is um like there's a term called DX developer experience. I would focus on tools that have that focus on AX like AI experience. So like what do the AI models what are AI models good at? If you notice um TypeScript is a big thing with AI models. Um, and the reason why the models will do good with TypeScript is because with Typescript there's a way to check if things are done right with types, right? And and this is getting technical, but the AI has a way to go through the code and even though it might be hallucinating, it can check if it's done things right based on the rules of TypeScript, right? So for example for me I usually use uh the database provider or the backend provider convex because I realize that AI is really good with writing convex code just because it's TypeScript right at the end of the day whatever you use until you start to really really scale you won't feel it once you scale you've made money you're rich congrats hire some developers you know send back the money to to the developers who who who've built these tools but I say that to say if I were to build something using AI I I would first find a solid template. Now, uh Riley, I don't know if you have a template. I have two that I use um on my GitHub. I have a React back when we first started. Yeah. We had templates, but they are out of date at this point because they go out of date relatively quickly. But I saw that Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I saw that you you messaged me that you have a template and I've actually forked this before and it works really well. and you're the first one who's started talking about payment templates which is actually like one of the biggest things that you know people want to make money with these tools and so you've kind of built that in and obviously there's keys you need to plug in right if you have a Stripe integration you need to plug in your Stripe account and that can be learned over time um yes but yeah anyway keep going yeah so once like I have two one was with react one's a react starter one's next starter the only difference is this one uses convex this one uses a postcrist database if If you're not a developer, it doesn't matter. Um, if you're a vibe coder, I would start with the React starter kit. And we'll talk about this in the next video. I also have a video on it on my channel. It's just easier to set up uh versus the next starter kit. Um, there's some like nuances that are a bit more difficult. So, I would start with a starter kit, get all my payments, DV off stuff figured out, and then what I would do using Claude Code, and this is this is this is key. Um, uh, Riley, I would tell Claude code to analyze the codebase and create a markdown file explaining the flow of the app, like how it works, how do the payments work, what it used, etc., etc. The reason being is now I'm going to use that file as a base layer, a knowledge base for it to continue to build features, right? So, the plan is going to be find a template, download the template, set it up using cloud code, tell me all the keys I need to set up, then build a markdown file telling me how the app works, and then what I'm going to do then is we're going to start building out features on top of this. So, we have our payments off and DB figured out. We just need to figure out the features and what we're going to build. And here's the cool part. I kid you not, couple days like for funsies, I would say 60% of the code is written by cloud code. I I wanted to build like my own um my own uh code rabbit but on the web, right? And I log in with with GitHub. I'll click on analyze and then this pulls all my public repos. I'll click analyze repo and I just want to show you what you can do with cloud code. This is basically a full-on editor. I I I did not I did not write the code for this. I I you you use cloud code to make this tool called vibe check.run. I saw I saw this on your Twitter and I was just like what is this? Is this a new cursor update? Like what's going on here? This is and this is where it blew my mind. 70% I can confidently say 70% of this code is written by um cloud code and then I'll click like security analysis and then I'll call the cloud 40 I have an agent that runs through all the code and then we'll suggest changes right and then these changes I haven't worked on this feature yet but I can push these changes to GitHub create a pull request and someone can merge that code change in this took me 2 days and when I say 2 days I'm talking about 2 hours each day and this was done through cloud code right so in 4 hours basically in 4 hours right you could have done this in a 4h hour window you created this this is insane just even the design alone the design for the chat is fantastic and here's the thing and it this would have maybe two weeks like I could have done this like but the impressive part for me is not that it did something I could do the impressive part is the time it saved Right. And with claw code, like again, I skimmed through the code. I looked at it. I saw what it did. I checked everything. And like Riley, I I I did this in like four, five hours of just me relaxing and and and just chilling. And this is why I think like you find you a solid template, right? You find you a solid template, you you know get you cloud code to analyze the codebase. By the way, don't judge me for my spelling. Cloud codebase. And then you build features. I am telling you you you're going to have a great time. Will you get stuck at times? Of course. Will things get difficult? Of course. We don't need to hypothesize about it. We're going to do it within the next week or two. We're going to do this. So, here's the here's the end of the episode is we are the next time uh Mickey and I talk. We are going to build an app with cloud code starting from your template that's going to is it it's going to have off, it's going to have payments, everything. It's going to have everything. and we're going to ship it live and by the end of the episode we're going to have a link for people to go to to see it. Right? That's the goal. We're going to make a mut. So, make sure you spam, like, share, whatever it is. Hell yeah. And then, by the way, uh to everyone who's watching, I'm going to link uh Mickey's YouTube channel. I'm also going to link your starter template and then whatever else you want uh me to link, your Twitter, etc., etc. Thank you for coming on. This is actually I think it's really useful to put these tools next to each other to kind of get this mental market map and I think it's actually useful to do with other categories as well. Like I was trying to look at the difference between N8N and Zape Zappier and make and try and figure out like what different tools are on the market like because you can't really use the tools unless you kind of know kind of it's it's always helpful to get that kind of perspective. And so I thank you. You're always like very good at explaining things. This is this was a lot of fun. So, thanks for coming on. First of all, I appreciate the privilege. I appreciate the kind words. Thank you so much for having me on. And yeah, like I just like man, like just have fun with the tools, right? Like a lot of them have free trials. Like a lot of them are a couple bucks a month. Like you know, just have fun. Like don't take it too seriously until you have to. 100%. 100%. All right. I'll talk to you later. All right. Bye everyone. Thank you, Riley. [Music]
